Thinking about joining? Brilliant — we'd love to have you. The Gwent MG Owners Club is open to all MG owners and enthusiasts, whatever model you drive (or aspire to own).

## Membership

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual membership fee and details from the live site -->

Membership gives you access to all club events, runs, and meetings throughout the year. We keep things affordable — the club is run by enthusiasts, not accountants.

For the current membership fee and details, please [get in touch](/contact/) or pop your head in at one of our [meetings](/meetings/).

## How to Sign Up

The easiest way to join is simply to come along to one of our [meetings](/meetings/). Have a chat, see if you like the look of us (we're pretty likeable), and sign up on the night.

You can also:

- **Contact us** via the [contact page](/contact/) and we'll get back to you with everything you need
- **Join the conversation** in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/361716657894284) where you can ask questions and get a feel for the club

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual sign-up process if there's an online form or postal address -->

## All Models Welcome

We welcome all MG models — classic or modern, project or pristine. The only requirement is enthusiasm for the marque.

Come and see us. The kettle's always on.
