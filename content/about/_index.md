The Gwent MG Owners Club is a friendly, welcoming club for MG enthusiasts across Gwent and South East Wales. We bring together owners and fans of all MG models — from the classic MGA and MGB to the more modern MGF, MGTF, and everything in between.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Replace with actual club history and background from the live site -->

Whether you're a seasoned classic car collector or you've just driven your first MG off the forecourt, you'll find a warm welcome here. The club is run by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts — no formality, just a shared love of great cars.

## What We Get Up To

Over the year we enjoy a range of activities together:

- **Regular meetings** — a chance to catch up, swap tips, and talk cars
- **Club runs and drives** — exploring the beautiful roads of South Wales and beyond
- **Shows and events** — attending and displaying at classic car shows in the region
- **Social events** — because it's not just about the cars (well, mostly it is)

## Open to All

You don't need to own an MG to come along — if you love these cars and want to be around people who do too, you're welcome. Come and see what we're about.
