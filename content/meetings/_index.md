# Meetings

We meet regularly throughout the year — it's one of the best parts of being in the club. A chance to catch up with fellow MG enthusiasts, hear what everyone's been up to with their cars, and generally have a good time.

## When We Meet

We hold regular meetings throughout the year. Check our [calendar](/calendar/) for the current schedule and any updates.

## Venue

Our meetings are held at a local venue in the Gwent area. Details of the exact location can be found on our [calendar](/calendar/) or by [getting in touch](/contact/).

## What to Expect

Meetings are relaxed and informal — come as you are. There's usually a chance to:

- Catch up over a drink
- Talk about your car (and everyone else's)
- Hear about upcoming events and runs
- Meet new members and old friends

If you're thinking about joining, a meeting is the perfect way to come and see what we're about. Just turn up — you'll be made to feel very welcome.
