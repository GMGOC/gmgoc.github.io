# Welcome to Gwent MG Owners Club

Whether you're a lifelong MG devotee or you've just picked up your first one, you're in the right place. We're a friendly bunch of MG enthusiasts based in the Gwent area of South East Wales, and we'd love to have you along.

We get together regularly to talk cars, go on drives, attend shows, and generally enjoy everything that makes owning an MG so special. All MG models welcome — from the classics to the modern day.
